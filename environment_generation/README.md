# Environment Generation

## Map Generation
`python generator.py`

This code only generates environments without scaling and colorization although we included related function in the main code.
We randomly colorize on every trial when we run the experiment with five random seeds.

## Environment Examples
We attached examples of colorized environments in `environments/`.
Note that, the size of each colored square is 3x3 (we scale up the environment by factor of 3).
